### What I learned

There is a lot of handy stuff that I came by while working on this. Espcially Kevin Powell's video that I followed alongside. Getting the picture to fit the container was something I just could not figure out so I went and found some help and got so much more. It's also really great to see that there are alot of resources related to accessibility.
